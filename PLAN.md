# Implementation Plan: Cybersecurity Vulnerability Testing Tool

## Important Notes

This plan is a **living document** and is designed to evolve as we build. It's totally expected and encouraged to:

- Modify steps as we learn new information during implementation
- Reorder tasks if dependencies change
- Add or remove steps based on what makes sense at the time
- Pivot on technical decisions if we discover better approaches
- Update future steps based on learnings from completed ones

The plan is a guide, not a contract. Flexibility is key to building the right solution.

## Phase 1: UI Foundation with Placeholder Data

### Setup & Core Layout

- [ ] Create a comprehensive placeholder data file (`src/data/placeholder-data.ts`) with:
  - [ ] Sample projects with various states
  - [ ] Sample test runs with different statuses (running, completed, failed)
  - [ ] Sample vulnerability results with different severity levels
  - [ ] Sample learnings/resources

  - [ ] Quick actions (view, test, delete)
  - [ ] Status indicators (last test date, pass/fail status)
- [ ] Create "New Project" modal/page
  - [ ] Project name input
  - [ ] URL input for the web application
- [ ] Build individual project detail page with tabs:
  - [ ] Test Runs tab (list of all test runs)
  - [ ] Learnings tab (uploaded resources)
- [ ] Add inline edit capability for project name and URL
  - [ ] Edit button next to project name
  - [ ] Inline URL editing

### Test Runs UI

  - [ ] Test configuration options (placeholder for now)
- [ ] Build test run list view
  - [ ] Timeline/history of test runs
  - [ ] Status badges (running, completed, failed)
  - [ ] Summary statistics
- [ ] Create detailed test run results page
  - [ ] Vulnerability findings list
  - [ ] Severity categorization (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - [ ] Detailed vulnerability descriptions (placeholder content)
- [ ] Add test run progress indicator
  - [ ] Progress bar or spinner while test is "running"
  - [ ] Mock progress updates with placeholder data

### Learnings/Resources UI

- [ ] Create learnings upload interface
  - [ ] URL input field
  - [ ] Batch URL upload capability
  - [ ] "Add Learning" button
- [ ] Build learnings list view

  - [ ] Brief summary description (placeholder)
  - [ ] Status indicators (processing, processed, failed)
  - [ ] Delete/remove capability
- [ ] Add learning details modal/page
  - [ ] Show full scraped content (placeholder)
  - [ ] Metadata display (date added, source, etc.)

## Phase 2: Backend Foundation

### Database Schema

- [ ] Design and implement Prisma schema for:
  - [ ] Projects table
  - [ ] TestRuns table (linked to projects)
  - [ ] Vulnerabilities table (linked to test runs)
  - [ ] Learnings table (linked to projects or global)
  - [ ] ScrapedContent table (linked to learnings)
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Create seed data matching placeholder structure

### tRPC API Layer

- [ ] Implement project CRUD operations
  - [ ] createProject

  - [ ] getTestRuns
  - [ ] getTestRun
  - [ ] updateTestRunStatus
- [ ] Implement learnings operations
  - [ ] addLearning
  - [ ] getLearnings
  - [ ] deleteLearning
- [ ] Add pagination support for list endpoints

### Connect UI to Backend

- [ ] Add data invalidation/refetching logic

## Phase 3: Core Functionality

### Web Scraping System

- [ ] Add scraping status tracking

### Test Execution Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up job queue for test runs
- [ ] Implement test run state machine
  - [ ] Queued → Running → Completed/Failed
- [ ] Create test run orchestration logic
- [ ] Add timeout and retry mechanisms

## Phase 4: AI Agent Integration

### Vulnerability Testing Agent

- [ ] **TODO: Define AI agent implementation details**
  - [ ] Choose AI model/service (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
  - [ ] Define agent architecture
  - [ ] Determine vulnerability detection strategies
  - [ ] Design prompt engineering approach
- [ ] Implement agent initialization
- [ ] Create vulnerability detection workflows
- [ ] Build result parsing and categorization
- [ ] Add confidence scoring for findings

### Knowledge Integration

- [ ] Connect scraped learnings to agent context
- [ ] Implement dynamic prompt building with learnings
- [ ] Create feedback loop for improving detection

## Phase 5: Testing & Refinement

### Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Add unit tests for critical business logic

## Notes on Placeholders

The following areas are intentionally left as placeholders to be defined later:

1. **Scraping Implementation**: The exact mechanism for scraping and processing learning resources
2. **AI Agent Details**: The specific implementation of the vulnerability testing agent
3. **Vulnerability Detection Logic**: The actual methods and techniques for finding vulnerabilities
4. **Test Configuration Options**: What parameters users can configure for tests

These will be updated as we progress and make technical decisions.
